		    <p>Tyrion Austin was born and raised in Baton Rouge, LA. He always had an interest in computers as a child and once he made it to highschool, he decided to take his very first Web Design class. While he enjoyed the class he wasn't entirely sure if he wanted to pursue Web Design but knew it was a choice for him in the future. Along with his love of computers he also loved music. He loved it so much that it was all he would think about and he would always listen to it in his spare time. He was always on top of up and coming artists and would be the person to introduce his friend to these new artists that he would come across.He would get to college and start to really see where he wanted to go as far as a career in the future. He attended University of Louisiana at Lafayette and pursued a degree in Music Business. This degree pretty much landed in his lap because the program was just being added into the Music School the same year and semester he actually began. He went through his 4 years of college by his senior year... it clicked! He knew that in the future he would want to create music and also create web and graphic design as a career. But it didn't come to him in his sleep.

		    <article class="secondpart">
		    <p>He was an intern at Dream Studios in Lafayette and he took notes from his mentor that he had while he was there. The mentor was a producer but also created flyers and CD covers for artists as well. And while it didn't really make sense before when he thought about it, he knew that it was definitely something he could pursue. Upon finishing his undergrad program, He took a year off to save money to go back to school for graphic and web design. He applied at a total of 3 schools and got into each one but there was one that called out to him, and that was the University of Florida. Currently finishing up his 1st semester in his grad program, he is working diligently to complete the program and develop his business from the ground up.</p>
